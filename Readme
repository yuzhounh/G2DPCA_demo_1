Generalized two dimensional principal component analysis by Lp-norm for image analysis. 
Copyright (C) 2018 Jing Wang

For 1D algorithms, the image data should be 2D matrix, nSub*(height*width). 
For 2D algorithms, the image data should be 3D matrix, height*width*nSub. 
The images are listed in the subject-by-subject manner. Please refer to the 
manuscript for more information about the experiments.

Variables:
FaceDB, Feret or ORL
x,   image data
rho, a tuning parameter in RSPCA or 2DPCAL1-S
s,   a tuning parameter in GPCA or G2DPCA
p,   a tuning parameter in GPCA or G2DPCA
nPV, number of projection vectors to be calculated
W,   projection vectors

Usage:
Run main.m to play this demo. 

Note:
In a server with 40 CPUs, G2DPCA_demo_1 takes about 2 days while 
G2DPCA_demo_2 takes about 1 day. Both of two demos comsume only a little 
memory.
